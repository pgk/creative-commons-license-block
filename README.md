Gutenberg Block Kit
===================

This is a minimal Gutenberg block development environment for Glitch. We 
want to get you up and running as fast as possible so that you can turn
your idea into a block.

Getting Started
---------------

You will want to [remix this project](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/gutenberg-block-kit)
to get an editable version of the code here. After you click the [remix
this project](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/gutenberg-block-kit) link, 
use the Show link at the top of the editor to see your new block.

Now you click on `src/block.js` on the file list on the left side, and 
start making changes. You should quickly see your changes as the editor
window updates.
